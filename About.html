			<p class="margin-b-10">Rudzani Muthambi Properties PTY LTD – (RMP), is a 100% black owned brainchild of a young female visionary, committed to raising the flags of Kwazulu – Natal, Limpopo and Mpumalanga provinces and the country through closing the skills and access to information gap. This is done by accurately preserving, representing and distributing Film and Television content in these areas, through an audience development project called iBioscope yeCommunity (Cinema for People’s Development), where we take films and filmmakers to communities thus making films accessible to the majority of South Africans. Our content includes shorts, features, and doccies all filmed in SA communities.</p>
			<p class="margin-b-10">Rudzani (CEO), an enthusiastic creative herself, has been involved in various aspects of the arts, culture and entertainment industry for the past 17 years. Having benefited from a range of work in radio, film, television, theatre and print media and contributed to the establishment and development of various cultural initiatives, she got to learn and appreciate the power of the arts to create change. From this was spawned the idea to form a Distribution Production Company that caters for Africans in the Film and Television industry. At the core of the company’s ethos is the recognition and respect of the cultural identity of indigenous people as an asset for economic development, and this forms the basis for the need to promote their stories.</p>
